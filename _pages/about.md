Hi, there. I am a Ph.D student at Beijing Institute of Technology, advised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aUnzdwIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao" style="text-decoration: none;">Prof. Chao Sun</a>. I earned my bachelor’s degree from Beijing Institute of Technology in 2022. 

My previous research focused on roadside / vehicle-side / collaborative / embodied 3D perception, aiming to enhance agents' spatial awareness for surrounding environment. I have been fortunate to collaborate with <a href="https://x-humanoid.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">X-Humanoid</a>. 

Currently my research interests lie in developing autonomous systems through spatial intelligence, generative models and reinforcement learning. 

My research interests include:

- Representation Learning and Spatial Alignment

- Reinforcement Learning with World Simulator

- VLA / VA / World Models in autonomous systems
