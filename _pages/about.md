Hi, there.  I am a Ph.D student at Beijing Institute of Technology, advised by Prof.<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aUnzdwIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao" style="text-decoration: none;">Chao Sun</a>. 

My previous research focused on roadside / vehicle-side / collaborative / embodied 3D perception, aiming to enhance agents' spatial awareness for surrounding environment. 

Currently my research interests lie in developing autonomous systems through spatial intelligence, generative AI and reinforcement learning.
